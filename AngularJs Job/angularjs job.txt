Hello,

The task is as following : 

Use asp.net MVC with EF and angularjs

up to you to extend the project structure to your way of working. we promote well designed and clean code. 

What I expect from you is to us this base to make a webproject with just a simple login page that use asp.net identity to check the credentials.
 (use the login layout from the template /html/page_signin.html ) 

After login it should open the invoice page where you can create a new invoice. 
You should be able to change the quantity of each item change the product and price and dynamically add a new line. 
Also the total price should be updated on each change. This should of course be done using angularjs 

(If this is not clear have a look at the template you should use : /html/page_invoice.html) 

There should also need to be a save button at the bottom that allow to save the invoice to the database. 

use entity framework for the database with code first and a local mdf file.

Can you do this project ? And do you have any questions about it ? 

Kind regards,
Thibault
